<h2>G SAKETH KUMAR</h2>
<br>
<p>I am a passionate Engineer with a degree in Electronics & 

Communication Engineering. My very first experience with code 

was at the time when I started my own blog. My struggle to 

customize the blog pages introduced me to HTML & CSS. Sooner, 

the excitment of having the power to structure pages on my own 

sounded amazing and thatâ€™s when I decided to purse Web 

development.
<br>
<p>Recently, I learnt Full Stack Development. I have knowledge of 

HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Java, C++ and Data Structures. Rational 

thought process and goal-oriented planning are my strengths.
<br>
<p>I am currently on the look out for a challenging role to build 

products that make a difference.
